Before diving into the analysis, it is crucial to ensure that the data is of high quality and suitable for further examination. This involves assessing the completeness, consistency, accuracy, and reliability of the datasets.\n","\n","**Washington Post Dataset:**\n","The Fatal Force dataset tracks details about each police-involved killing in the United States. The data is collected from various sources, including local news reports, law enforcement websites, social media, and independent databases. The Washington Post, the curator of this dataset, conducts additional reporting to enhance its accuracy and comprehensiveness. The dataset focuses on shootings where a police officer, in the line of duty, shoots and kills a civilian. It does not include deaths in police custody or non-shooting deaths.\n","\n","**Fatal Encounters Dataset:**\n","The Fatal Encounters dataset aims to document all deaths that occur when police are present or caused by the police, regardless of the circumstances. The dataset includes on-duty and off-duty incidents, criminal and line-of-duty cases, intentional and accidental deaths. It is designed to be a comprehensive resource for analyzing police-related fatalities. The data is made available for free, and the project relies on support to continue its data collection efforts.\n","\n","**Police Deaths Dataset:**\n","The Police Deaths dataset focuses on incidents involving the deaths of police officers. The primary source of data is the Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP), which has been maintained since 1996 by a police officer. The dataset provides information about police officers who lost their lives in the line of duty.\n","\n","**Tax Policy Center Dataset:** The Tax Policy Center dataset provides insights into how state and local governments allocate their resources across different expenditure categories relative to personal income.\n","\n","**Source**: [Washington Post Dataset](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings), [Fatal Encounters Dataset](https://fatalencounters.org), [Police Deaths Dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/police-deaths), [Tax Policy Center Dataset](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/state-and-local-general-expenditures-percentage-personal-income)\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"UExr5-Pq8mIf"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import warnings\n","import os"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"XBNMAq868oIB"},"outputs":[],"source":["warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":9,"status":"ok","timestamp":1684847620782,"user":{"displayName":"Othmane BENCHEKROUN","userId":"04619760797686070988"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"bTB8_YVHp8ww","outputId":"90d17c6f-81f0-4c21-ec88-a5cc58f93066"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'/content'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}],"source":["%pwd"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":17992,"status":"ok","timestamp":1684847638767,"user":{"displayName":"Othmane BENCHEKROUN","userId":"04619760797686070988"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"1Wyv_aYnp-3P","outputId":"4350ef1d-5074-4ea0-ae11-1192493a7e01"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"gDuYmlgaXo1o"},"outputs":[],"source":["pd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", 20)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IB2zhS2ymthQ"},"source":["# Washington Post Database1\n","## Data Importation\n","<div style=\"width: 800px;\">To kickstart our analysis, we'll begin by importing the dataset into our Jupyter Notebook.
